# Password-Generator-Django

This repository was created with the intention of putting into practice studies based on Django, python, with a little Javascript. The project will generate a random password as the user selects the fields that will influence its creation.

I chose to create the field that displays the password as an input, so if the user likes the password and wants to increment, decrement, he can edit the field. For the sake of design, the field with the password starts invisible and is only displayed when the user generates the password, I thought it was interesting to bring this feature. When using Javascript, I used it in the Copy button action, so the user doesn't need to click and copy manually, the Copy button is a good option thinking about the user's usability.

I finish this project with HTML, CSS, bootstrap, Django, python and javascript technologies.
